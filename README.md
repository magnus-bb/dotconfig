# Configurations and software for Linux distros

## Cloning this repo
If you wish to clone this repo, use:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules
```

This will make sure you get the zsh-plugin files that are included as submodules.

## Overview
At the root if this repo, you will find directories for specific distros / desktop environments and a `shared` directory for things that work across distros and DEs. The distro names are chosen based on what the items have been tested with, but something like `ubuntu` should probably work with any Debian-based distro etc. Navigate into the directory matching your distro / desktop environment and follow the README.md for that particular environment.

## Installation
If no other readmes are present, assume that the files are just to be placed inside the directory that matches the folder structure in this directory. Everything inside `~` should match your `/home/USERNAME/`.

That means that you can copy all configurations from this repo by cloning this repo, navigating into your environment of choice and copying all files inside the `~` directory into your home directory with:
```sh
sudo cp -ri ./~/* ~
```

Be aware that this will overwrite any existing files with the same name as the files in this repo, but will prompt you before overwriting. **I recommend copying files and directories manually**.

## GNOME extensions

### [MRPIS Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1379/mpris-indicator-button/)
Control media player from top panel.

### [Bluetooth Quick Connect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1401/bluetooth-quick-connect/)
Connect to usb devices from the top panel.

### [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock)
More dock customization. Also allows for blur my shell to work with the dock (in panel mode works best).

### [Coverflow Alt-Tab](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/97/coverflow-alt-tab/)
Cool window-switching with alt+tab.

### [Compiz windows effect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3210/compiz-windows-effect/)
Makes windows flexible when moving.

### [Burn my windows](https://github.com/Schneegans/Burn-My-Windows)
Adds effects to opening and closing windows.


### [gTile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/)
Tiling window manager.


### [Hide Activities Button](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/744/hide-activities-button/)
Does what it says.

### [Clipboard History](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4839/clipboard-history/)
Shows what you have had in your clipboard and allows you to re-copy old clipboard items.

### [Sound Input & Output Device Chooser](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/906/sound-output-device-chooser/)
Quick menu to choose input / output devices for sound.

### [Top Panel Workspace Scroll](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/701/top-panel-workspace-scroll/)
Scroll on the top panel to change workspace.

### [Workspace Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/21/workspace-indicator/)
Shows you the workspaces you are using.

### [User Themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/)
Allows you to set shell themes.

### [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)
Adds blurred top bar etc.

I recommend setting brightness to 80% and blur to 20%, adding blur to Dash to Dock (in panel mode), and using with WhiteSur theme.

### [Vertical workspaces](https://github.com/G-dH/vertical-workspaces)
Does what it says.

Does not work well when blurring dock with Blur My Shell, since it resets the blur effect after using the overview.

If you use the default GNOME, you will need to remap some shortcuts for Control + Super + arrow keys to change workspaces and Shift + Super + arrow keys to move windows to other workspaces. In dconf-editor, these are `/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-up` and `/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-down` as well as `/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/move-to-workspace-up` and `/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/move-to-workspace-down`.

```

`ls` is aliased to `lsd` with some other handy shortcuts in `~/.zsh/aliases.zsh`.

### [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
**Better version of `cat` with syntax-highlight, git changes, line numbers etc.**

Install with:
```sh
sudo nala install bat
```

Because of clashes with other packages, this might install the binary as `batcat`.

### TODO: add https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search

### Syntax highlight plugin
**Adds color feedback that tells you whether a command/package exists/is spelled correctly.**

Configuration is already included, and files are already installed in `.zsh/fast-syntax-highlighting/`.

**TODO:** Check out `zsh-syntax-highlighting` instead (comes with Garuda) and check which is better.

### Completion plugin
**Better completion on tabs.**

Configuration is already included, and files are already installed in `.zsh/completion.zsh`.

### Autosuggestions plugin
**Uses your history to suggest a command, press RIGHT to accept it.**

Configuration is already included, and files are already installed in `.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions/`.

### Hotkeys
`.zshrc` is configured to force CTRL + BACKSPACE / DELETE to delete whole words and CTRL + LEFT / RIGHT to jump whole words, no matter the terminal used (some terms already have this).

### [TheFuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
**Type `fuck` or double tap ESC when a command is misspelled or wrong.**

This works VERY well with git and other software that tries to guess your intended command, whereas the 'correct' option just handles misspellings.

Configuration is included, but TheFuck will have to be installed with:

```sh
sudo nala install thefuck
```

If you have any issues because of the `distutils` package missing, it can be fixed with:
```sh
sudo nala install python3-distutils -y
```

### Glob support
You can use wildcards (`*`) in variables to e.g. show all matching files:
```bash
files='*.js'
echo $files
```
Will give you a list of all javascript files in your current dir.

## Fonts

### Fira Code Nerd Font
Get the font from [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.2.2/FiraCode.zip).

This font is used for the Mira conky widget, and not otherwise needed.

## Misc.

Remember to reload nautilus / Files after setting these with `nautilus -q`.

### [Nautilus terminal](https://github.com/flozz/nautilus-terminal)
Embeds a terminal with your default shell in Nautilus, which can be toggled with `F4`.
